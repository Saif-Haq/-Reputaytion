5 Extremely Poor Questions for Taylor Swift During the Reputation Era

As a bad journalist interviewing Taylor Swift during her Reputation album cycle, I might ask these superficial, potentially offensive, or completely misguided questions:

1. "So... are all these angry songs about Kanye West and Kim Kardashian? Can you tell us exactly which lyrics are about them?"

2. "You've gone through a lot of boyfriends over the years. Which ex is the snake in your new music videos supposed to represent?"

3. "Your new look is so different - the dark lipstick, the edgy clothes. Are you worried about alienating your younger fans with this more mature, darker image?"

4. "Many critics are saying your new music isn't as good as your earlier work. How do you respond to people who think you've sold out?"

5. "You've been pretty quiet on social media lately. Is that because you're trying to hide something from your fans, or are you just too busy with your new boyfriend to post anymore?"
